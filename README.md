# DataAnalysisTool

I'm developing a data analysis tool. It will encompass all essential frameworks for machine learning, including ANN, CNN, RNN, NLP, Autoencoders, GANs, and their hybrid models to tackle real-world problems. Currently, I've completed the ANN_example for simple case and ANN_regression model for predicting house prices using regression on Kaggle. More features are in the works, and datasets will be provided upon completion.

Real-world scenarios are often more complex. For instance, during RNA triplex stability data analysis, I employed advanced methodologies. Expect even more diverse and sophisticated analysis methods in future updates.
