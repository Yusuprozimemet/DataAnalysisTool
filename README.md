# DataAnalysisTool

I'm developing a data analysis tool that I believe will be the coolest in its class. It will encompass all essential frameworks for machine learning, including ANN, CNN, RNN, NLP, Autoencoders, GANs, and their hybrid models to tackle real-world problems. Currently, I've completed the ANN_example for simple case and ANN_regression model for predicting house prices using regression on Kaggle. More features are in the works, and datasets will be provided upon completion.

Real-world scenarios are often more complex. For instance, during RNA triplex stability data analysis, I employed advanced methodologies. Expect even more diverse and sophisticated analysis methods in future updates.

Enjoy exploring the tool! Don't hesitate to reach out if you encounter any issues.
